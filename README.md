# navx-rs
Rust support for frc NavX build on top of [wpilib](https://github.com/Lytigas/first-rust-competition).

Currently, only the SPI interface and get_yaw are implemented. The framework is in place for all the other register based protocols, though. Note that this has not been rigorously tested. Any pull requests or bug reports are highly appreciated!
